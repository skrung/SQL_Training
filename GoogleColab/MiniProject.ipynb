        "\n",
        "This mini-project focuses on building a database system for managing a library. It allows you to practice data modeling, SQL queries, and data manipulation techniques. Here's the breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Database Design:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Create tables for:\n",
        "    * Books (book_id, title, author, ISBN, genre, publication_year)\n",
        "    * Members (member_id, name, contact_info, membership_type)\n",
        "    * Loans (loan_id, book_id, member_id, loan_date, return_date)\n",
        "* Establish relationships between tables using foreign keys. (e.g., Loans.book_id references Books.book_id)\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Functionality:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Implement functionalities using SQL queries:\n",
        "    * Add, edit, and delete books in the library.\n",
        "    * Register new members and update their information.\n",
        "    * Issue books to members (update loan table with loan details).\n",
        "    * Return books (update loan table with return date).\n",
        "    * Search for books by title, author, or ISBN.\n",
        "    * List books borrowed by a specific member and their due dates.\n",
        "    * Generate reports on the most popular books, overdue loans, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefits:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Practice data modeling principles for relational databases.\n",
        "*  Learn CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using SQL.\n",
        "*  Gain experience with data manipulation and querying techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "This mini-project provides a good starting point for learning database management systems. You can adjust the complexity and features based on your skill level and interests."
